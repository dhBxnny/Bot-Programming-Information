## Bot Development Processes.
1. Planning;
   If you completely decided that you will be purchasing a custom bot from me, I start asking a few questions about how you want your bot to look like; username, logo, etc and the features you want it to contain.
2. Starting;
   If, sadly, I cannot start at the moment you hire me, I will make sure to start the next day since the first minute my personal computer is up and running.
3. Creation;
   Depending on the complexity of the features you asked me to create, I make take a few time (maximum 1 day) or more time (1 or more days).
4. Hosting & Payment; 
   After I have finished your bot, I will notify you instantly and wait for the payment to happen.
   When the payment is done, I will host your bot instantly on a VPS (Virtual Private Server).

## Pricing
As any normal developer, I charge for my services. You may pay me either on Robux or EUR (€).

Currently, I don't have specific prices, meaning that I will determine the cost of your order when you have told and explained me every features you want the bot to have.

I currently prefer be paid on the EUR (€) currency, as I have some stuff to pay, but if you cannot pay on that currency, I accept Robux.

If you try to pay me with stuff like a rank in your group, I definitely **will not** accept. You must pay either on EUR (€) or Robux.

You can give me additional things, such as 'Honored Member' role on your Discord Server, as that would be a gift.

## Additional Information
I do not refund; after you've got your bot, if you are not happy with it and want to cancel it, I will not refund your bot as you have got your product with everything you asked me to create.

No scams; if you try to scam me and get a bot for free, I will not allow it, therefore I will make a permanent blacklist to you from my services disallowing you to order from me again.
You will also not get your product as you have tried to get it for free.

I can make a minor discount, but not big or making your bot for free.

Please, note that nothing in this world is perfect, therefore the VPS (Virtual Private Server) where I host the bots I create can have a downtime, and it is nothing I can fix, sadly.

## Questions? Concerns?
If you do have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach me out on Discord through the direct messages feature.
