# Rules
Here is a list of rules you must follow if you do not want to be blacklisted from using my services.
##
1. **Do not rush me**; I like taking my time to complete the order, not being begged. If you hurry me, I will take more time to complete your bot as I am talking to you and that takes time away from me.

2. **I will not go first**; I am not going to give you the bot first. Payment will always go first and the bot will go after the payment is completed. 
If you need more time, I can give you more time to complete the payment.

3. **No free bots**; I am not going to make you a bot for free. I valorate my time and, as you may understand, making a free bot takes time away from me without getting anything.
Trying to get a free bot multiple times after I said "no" to your free bot request will result in a blacklist with the reasons of: Trying to get a free bot and begging me.

4. **No refunds**; Not happy with your bot? Not my problem. I made what you asked me to do. Being not happy with your bot is your problem and I will not refund your payment as you got what you wanted.
